# Use QueryExpression to retrieve data

<!-- 
The mechanics of using RetrieveMultiple with QE. 

 - Inherits from QueryBase
 - Constructors and methods vs Object initialization
 - When to use RetrieveMultipleRequest
 - Properties of EntityCollection used for subsequent requests
 - Is the 'shape' of the result different since you can't specify column aliases?
    - Is FetchXml 'flat' vs what you get from QE?
