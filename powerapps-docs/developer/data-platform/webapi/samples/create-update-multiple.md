# Sample: Web API Use bulk operations

These sample applications on GitHub show how to perform bulk create and update operations using the Web API CreateMultiple and UpdateMultiple actions. The messages for these actions are optimized to provide the most performant way to create or update records with Dataverse.

This sample is a Visual Studio .NET 6.0 solution that contains two projects that perform the same operations in different ways so that you can compare the performance of each method.

See the README.md file in each sample for detailed instructions about how to run the sample and what it does.
