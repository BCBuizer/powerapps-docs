# Export and import a canvas app as a single app file

In this article, you'll learn how to export and import a single canvas app. Before you begin, review the overview article to understand all different options as there are several options available to export and import canvas apps.

Using this option, you’re able to export a single canvas app in the format of a .msapp file extension. This allows you to export a single file that contains the canvas app that you’re currently editing and import it.


## Export .msapp files in Power Apps

1. Sign in to Power Apps at [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com). 
1. Open the canvas app that you’d like to export in Power Apps Studio.  
1. In the Power Apps Studio, select **Save** drop-down menu and then select, **Download a copy**. 
 
    The .msapp file will be downloaded to your device.  

## Import .msapp files in Power Apps
1. Sign in to Power Apps at [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. From the left navigation pane, select **Apps**.
1. Select **Import app** > **From file (.msapp)**. 

    This opens Power Apps Studio where you can choose the appropriate .msapp file to import. Power Apps Studio will then reload with the .msapp file opened. 

For more information on resources included in the single app file, see [Resources included](export-import-app.md#resources-included-canvas-apps-as-app-packages).

## Permissions required to export a canvas app  

Only the **Owner** or **Co-owner** of an app can export a canvas app package. To import an app, the **Environment Maker** permission is required on the destination environment.
