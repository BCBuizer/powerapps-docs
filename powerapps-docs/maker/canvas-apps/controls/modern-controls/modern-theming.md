# Use modern themes in canvas apps

Modern themes, which are pre-established style sets, can transform the look of your app. These themes, based on Microsoft's Fluent design language, modify various style aspects such as color, typography, borders, and shadows, ensuring a visually pleasing and consistent interface. Modern theming streamlines the customization process, enabling creators to effortlessly design an app with a unified and consistent visual appeal.

## Prerequisites 

To use modern themes, you need to enable it. More information, see [Enable modern controls and themes for your app](overview-modern-controls.md#enable-modern-controls-and-themes-for-your-app).

> [!NOTE]
> When modern controls and themes is enabled, you won't be able to select classic themes from the command bar. To use **retired** classic themes, you'll need to enable the **Keep classic themes** retired app setting.  

## Create a theme

There's several out-of-the-box themes available to style your app. You can also design your own theme for a more personalized visual aesthetic.

1. On the app authoring menu, select > ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.
2. On the **Themes** pane, select **Add a theme**.
3. In the **Create a theme** dialog, enter the following information:
    -  **Theme name**: The theme name must be unique.
    -  **Font**: Choose the default font that the controls in the app use will use when the theme is applied.
    -  **Seed color**: Select the color you want to base your theme on, or manually enter the Hex or RGB representation of the color. 
    -  **Lock primary color (preview)**: This option provides flexibility for how the 16-slot theme palette is generated using the seed color.
       -  When disabled, the system generates the 16-slot palette in a way that is optmized for accessibility. This is the default value. 
       -  When enabled, the selected seed color will be placed in the primary (middle) slot of the palette. The remaining colors are generated by making the colors incrementally lighter on one side and darker on the other side. Note that with this option, the generated palette may not meet contrast ratio accessibility requirements.  
         > [!IMPORTANT]
         > Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
    -  **Hue/Vibrancy**: Adjust the generation palette, especially the lighter colors, with the **Hue** and **Vibrancy** sliders. The **Hue** impacts the color shade, and **vibrancy** impacts the muteness or brightness of the palette. These sliders are not applicable if you have chosen to "lock the primary color".  
4. Optionally, look at the static preview of your new theme. You can interact with the sample controls to see how your theme is applied to the rest state and various interaction states.    
5. Select **Create**.

Your new theme is created and applied to your app.

## Apply modern theme 

1. On the app authoring menu, select > ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.
2. On the **Themes** pane, select one of the default themes.
3. If you have classic controls in your app, you will be given the option to apply the modern theme to these controls. You can always select Undo if you don't like the results of the theme application. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > When modern themes are applied to classic controls, Power Fx formulas are set on properties of the impacted controls that reference variables from the modern theme. Visually, classic controls may not align exactly with their modern control counterparts, as the classic controls are not based on Fluent v9.
    
When a modern theme is selected, the style of the theme is automatically applied to the controls in your app. This action sets the **App.Theme** property. 


## Edit a theme
You can edit the theme and change one or more parameters of the custom theme.

1. On the app authoring menu, select > ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.
2. On the **Themes** pane, find the tile corresponding to the theme you want to edit and select **Options** > **Edit**.
3. On the **Edit theme** pane, adjust the theme as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't edit out-of-the-box themes.

## Delete a theme
If you decide you no longer need a custom theme in your app, you can delete it.

1. On the app authoring menu, select > ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.
2. On the **Themes** pane, find theme that you want to edit and then, select (...) **Options** > **Delete**.
3. On the confirmation dialog box, select **Delete theme**.

If you have any Power Fx formulas that reference this theme in your app, you need to manually update the formula.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete out-of-the-box themes.

## Use themes with Power Fx

Modern theme objects are available for makers to use through Power Fx. The currently active theme object can be referenced by **App.Theme**, and any theme loaded into the app can be referenced by its instance name such as **RedTheme**. We recommend that you reference the theme object using **App.Theme** to ensure that the color selections adapt to theme changes.  

Each theme object includes the following information: 
-  **Name**: The name of the theme.
-  **Colors**: A collection of the 16 colors comprising the brand ramp for the theme, individually accessible by name, and the primary foreground color, which is the default text color when text is placed on a background using the theme's primary color.
-  **Font**: The font used by the theme.  

The image shows the slot variables inside the **Colors** collection and, as an example, the corresponding colors for the **Steel** theme.  
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Turn on modern controls](media/modern-themes-color-ramp.png)

Using the theme brand ramp, you can manually style a classic control based on the current modern theme such as **Button.Fill = App.Theme.Colors.Primary**.
