# Disconnect Git version control to edit canvas apps 

Git version control for editing apps has been removed and is no longer supported. 

If your app currently uses this feature, follow these steps to disconnect it:

1. Open your [canvas app for editing](edit-app.md) in Power Apps Studio. On the command bar, select **Settings**.
1. Select **Git version control** and then select **Disconnect**.


 > [!NOTE]
 > Git version control will be replaced with the source control integration feature. More information: [Source code integration](/power-platform/release-plan/2024wave1/data-platform/source-code-integration)
