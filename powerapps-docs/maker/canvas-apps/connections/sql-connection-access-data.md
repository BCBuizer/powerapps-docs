# Access data in SQL Server

One common data access pattern is to use a view (or table) and then stored procedures for create, update, and delete. This pattern uses a table with a trigger added to log changes to an audit table. This access pattern's built-in paging capability for Power Apps through galleries or tables helps keep the app performant.

> [!NOTE]
> If a table has a trigger, then you can't use the direct pattern `Submit()` for create, update, and delete. `Submit()` has a conflict between the handling of SQL triggers and the built-in Power Apps behavior, which uses the same output parameter. You can directly access the table for query purposes, but to handle `Create`, `Update`, or `Delete` you must call a stored procedure.

## Add a data source

### Use a view

Views show up in the list of tables you can select when you add a data source. Views only support queries—not updates. You must use a [stored procedure](#use-stored-procedures) for updates.

If you create a table with the `Start with data` option, you get screens and formulas that display records in a gallery and form. You can see formulas and functionality for creation, editing, and deletion. However, if you use a view, you only see a display screen for the gallery and form.

You might want the autogenerated screens from `Start with data` for views.

For this autogenerated option:

1. Choose `Start with data` with a *basic table*.
1. Delete and replace the table data source.

   You can also replace other create, update, and delete formulas with a view data source and stored procedure calls.  

### Use stored procedures

When you add a SQL Server connection to your app, you can add stored procedures and call them directly in Power Fx. This feature also works with secure implicit connections.

:::image type="content" source="media/connection-azure-sqldatabase/tables-views-stored-proc-selector.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows lists of tables, views, and stored procedures available to be added to your app.":::

Once you select a stored procedure, a child node appears and you can designate the stored procedure as **Safe to use for galleries and tables**. If you check this option, you can assign your stored procedure as an **Items** property in galleries for tables to use in your app.

**Enable this option only if**:

1. There are **no side effects** to calling this procedure on demand.

   You should be able to call the procedure multiple times or whenever Power Apps refreshes the control. When used with an **Items** property of a gallery or table, Power Apps calls the stored procedure whenever the system determines a refresh is needed. You can't control when the stored procedure is called.

1. You return a modest amount of data in the stored procedure.

   Action calls, such as stored procedures, don't have a limit on the number of rows retrieved. They aren't automatically paged in 100 record increments like tabular data sources such as tables or views.
  
   If the stored procedure returns too much data (many thousands of records), then your app might slow down or crash. For performance reasons, bring in less than 2,000 records.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The schema of the return values of the stored procedure should be *static*, so the values don't change from call to call. For example, if a stored procedure returns two tables, then it *always* returns two tables. You can work with either typed or untyped results.
>
> The structure of the results also need to be static. For example, if the schema of the results are *dynamic*, then results are untyped and you must provide a type in order to use them in Power Apps. For more information, see [Untyped results](sql-method-to-access-results.md#untyped-results).

#### SQL namespace prepended to stored procedure name

The SQL Server namespace name, where you store the procedure, is prepended to the stored procedure name. For example, all stored procedures in the **'DBO'** SQL Server namespace have **'dbo'** at the start of the name.

For example, when you add a stored procedure, you might see more than one data source in your project.

:::image type="content" source="media/connection-azure-sqldatabase/sqlserver-datasources.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows SQL data sources.":::

### Calling a stored procedure

To use a stored procedure in Power Apps, prefix the stored procedure name with the name of connector associated with it followed by the stored procedure name, such as `Paruntimedb.dbonewlibrarybook`.

> [!NOTE]
> When Power Apps brings in the stored procedure, it concatenates the namespace and procedure name so that `dbo.newlibrarybook` becomes `dbonewlibrarybook`.  

Arguments are passed as a Power Apps record with named value pairs:

```power-fx
<datasourceName>.<StoredprocedureName>({<paramName1: value, paramName2: value, ... >})
```

Remember to convert values if needed as you pass them into your stored procedure, since you're reading from a text value in Power Apps. For example, if you're updating an integer in SQL you must convert the text in the field using `Value()`.

:::image type="content" source="media/connection-azure-sqldatabase/calling-sp-directly.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to call stored procedures directly using key/value pairs and dot notation.":::

## Variables and all stored procedures

You can access a stored procedure for the **Items** property of a gallery after you declare it safe for the UI. Reference the data source name and the name of the stored procedure followed by `ResultSets`. You can access multiple results by referencing the set of tables returned such as Table 1, Table 2, etc.

For example, a stored procedure accessed from `Paruntimedb` with the name `dbo.spo_show_all_library_books()` looks like:

```power-fx
Paruntimedb.dbospshowalllibrarybooks().ResultSets.Table1
```

This query populates the gallery with records. However, stored procedures are *action* behaviors on the tabular model. `Refresh()` only works with tabular data sources and can't be used with stored procedures. You must refresh the gallery when a record is created, updated, or deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use a `Submit()` on a form for a tabular data source, it effectively calls `Refresh()` under the hood and updates the gallery.

### Use a variable to populate and refresh the gallery

Use a variable in the `OnVisible` property for the screen and set the stored procedure to the variable.

```power-fx
Set(SP_Books, Paruntimedb.dbospshowalllibrarybooks().ResultSets.Table1);
```

You can then set the `Items` property of the gallery to the variable name.

```power-fx
SP_Books
```

After you create, update, or delete a record with a call to the stored procedure, set the variable again to update the gallery.

```power-fx
Paruntimedb.dbonewlibrarybook({   
  book_name: DataCardValue3_2.Text, 
  author: DataCardValue1_2.Text,
    ...
});
Set(SP_Books, Paruntimedb.dbospshowalllibrarybooks().ResultSets.Table1);
```

## Use Power Automate to call stored procedures

Power Automate handles asynchronous actions best. You can call stored procedures as part of a series of calls in a business process.

To call Power Automate followed by a call to stored procedures, create input variables as part of your flow.

:::image type="content" source="media/connection-azure-sqldatabase/pa-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Power Automate input.":::

Then pass your input variables into the call of your stored procedure.

:::image type="content" source="media/connection-azure-sqldatabase/pa-execute-procedure.png" alt-text="Execute stored procedure":::

Add this Power Automate flow to your app and call it. The optional arguments are passed as a record “{ … }”. The following example has all optional arguments.
