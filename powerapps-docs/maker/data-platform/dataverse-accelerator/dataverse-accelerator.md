# Dataverse Accelerator App (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

The Dataverse Accelerator is a first party application that provides access to select experimental preview features and tooling related to Dataverse development. The featured set of capabilities include early prototype experiences that represent backlog features scheduled to be in the native platform and tools for enriching Dataverse development for makers, delivered in a convenient and accessibile web application built with low code.

While experimental preview features should not be used in production instances, it offers the opportunity to proactively evaluate, share feedback, and prepare more for integration. Using features in the Dataverse Accelerator helps you leverage cutting-edge capabilities to enhance productivity, optimize Dataverse processes, and maintain a competitive edge in Power Platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

Our interface adheres to the same UX and accessibility standards as any first-party Power Platform experience. Furthermore, it serves as a demonstration of our platform's powerful low-code capability to ship enterprise-grade applications.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [Low Code Plugins](/powerapps-docs/maker/data-platform/low-code-plug-ins.md) | Reusable, real-time workflows that execute a specific set of commands within Dataverse, running server-side and triggered by personalized event handlers, defined in Power Fx. |
| [Plugin monitoring](./plugin-monitoring.md) | A modern interface to surface the existing plugin trace log table in Dataverse environments, designed for developing and debugging Dataverse plugins and custom APIs.  |
| API playground | * *Coming soon* * Quickly and conveniently interact with the Dataverse Web API in a pre-authenticated software testing tool. |

## Get started

Play the Dataverse Accelerator app in any environment where it's installed.

The app is automatically available in all new Microsoft Dataverse environments, but you can also [manually install it](./dataverse-accelerator.md#installation-instructions) in existing Dataverse environments.

### Prerequisites to run the Dataverse Accelerator

You must have the following privileges in your Dataverse environment:

- Security role: System customizer
- App-level access to the Dataverse accelerator model driven app (e.g., system customizer or direct access from a security role)

### How the app appears in your environment

The app appears in two places:

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), select **Apps**

   ![Power Apps Maker App List](./media/apps.svg)

1. In the **Unified Interface apps** view:

   ![Power Apps Unified Client Applications View](./media/uci.svg)

## Manage the Dataverse Accelerator app

The Dataverse Accelerator is automatically installed as a first party package in all new environments. It's hosted and distributed using the App Source framework as a [Dynamics 365 app](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps).

### Prerequisites for managing the app

You must have the following security role assignment and your Dataverse environment must be above the minimum version.

- Security role: You must have the System administrator security role on the environment.

- A Dataverse environment with minimum Database (DB) version of `9.2.22122.00148`. You can check the Database version:  
  - In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) > Environment page > Version card.
  - By using the [RetrieveVersion function](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/retrieveversion) with your browser. Type `https://<your org>.<your region code>.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/RetrieveVersion` in your browser address bar and view the JSON returned.

### Install the Dataverse Accelerator

If the Dataverse Accelerator is not already installed in an environment, follow the steps to [install an app in the environment view](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#install-an-app-in-the-environment-view) for the Dataverse Accelerator offering.

<!---
#### Validating successful install

To verify that the Dataverse Accelerator application installed successfully:

1. In the Power Platform Admin Center > Select Environments.
1. Select the environment you chose to install the Dataverse Accelerator application.
1. In the Resources card, select the Dynamics 365 apps link.
1. You should find the Dataverse Accelerator app listed with a Status of Installed.

### Update the Dataverse Accelerator

If the Dataverse Accelerator is already installed and you want to install the latest version, follow these steps:

1. In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) > Environment page
1. Open the [environment-level view of apps](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#environment-level-view-of-apps)
1. Locate the **Dataverse Accelerator** app listing.
1. If an update is available, click the **Update available** link next to the listing.

### Uninstall the Dataverse Accelerator

You can delete the Dataverse Accelerator app from an environment using pac cli.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting the Dataverse Accelerator app will not delete all underlying capibilities presented in the app. The app provides a modern shell to the underlying platform API.

Using pac cli, [connect to the target environment](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/connection#pac-connection-create) and execute the three [solution delete](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/solution#pac-solution-delete) commands below:

```powershell
pac solution delete --solution-name msdyn_DataverseAcceleratorApp
pac solution delete --solution-name DataverseAccelerator
pac solution delete --solution-name DataverseAccelerator_Anchor
```

## Limitations and known issues

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Dataverse Accelerator user interface is built on the Power Platform [custom pages feature](../../model-driven-apps/model-app-page-overview.md). As part of these updates we're deploying into environments using system maintenance accounts. In some circumstances these accounts have had an unexpected side effect of presenting as a [break-glass account](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access). We're working to correct this behavior as quickly as possible. In the meantime the following apps might appear in the Power Platform admin center:
> - Dataverse Accelerator app â€“ &lt;model-driven app&gt;, created by a global admin account
> - Dataverse Actions page - &lt;canvas app&gt; This is a Custom page on which the low-code plugin is built, created with the user name associated to the global admin account.
> - Overview page - &lt;canvas app&gt; This is a custom page on which the low-code plugin is built, created with the user name associated to the global admin account.

- The Dataverse Accelerator is not available in GCC/GCC High.
