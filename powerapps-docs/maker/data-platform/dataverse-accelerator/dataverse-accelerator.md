# Use the Dataverse Accelerator (preview)

The Dataverse Accelerator is a powerful toolkit designed to streamline and expedite the development process within Microsoft Dataverse. By leveraging pre-built components, templates, and best practices, developers can significantly reduce development time while maintaining high standards of quality and efficiency.

> [!NOTE]
> The Dataverse Accelerator user interface is built on the Power Platform [custom pages feature](../../model-driven-apps/model-app-page-overview.md). As part of these updates we're deploying into environments using system maintenance accounts. In some circumstances these accounts have had an unexpected side effect of presenting as a [break-glass account](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access). We're working to correct this behavior as quickly as possible. In the meantime the following apps might appear in the Power Platform admin center:
> - Dataverse Accelerator app â€“ &lt;model-driven app&gt;, created by a global admin account
> - Dataverse Actions page - &lt;canvas app&gt; This is a Custom page on which the low-code plugin is built, created with the user name associated to the global admin account.
> - Overview page - &lt;canvas app&gt; This is a custom page on which the low-code plugin is built, created with the user name associated to the global admin account.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using the Dataverse Accelerator, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Access to a Microsoft Dataverse environment.
- Basic familiarity with Power Platform and Dataverse concepts.
- Appropriate permissions to install and configure solutions (e.g., system administrator or system customizer security role)
- Access to the Dataverse accelerator app.

## Manage the Dataverse Accelerator app

The Dataverse Accelerator app is hosted on App Source as a [Dynamics 365 app](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps). It is automatically installed in every new environment, and can be managed through the existing App Source platform.

### Install

The Dataverse Accelerator app is automatically installed in all Power Platform environments with a Microsoft Dataverse database enabled.

If the Dataverse Accelerator is not already installed in an environment, follow the steps to [install an app in the environment view](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#install-an-app-in-the-environment-view) for the Dataverse Accelerator.

### Update

If the Dataverse Accelerator is already installed in your environment and you want to install the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [environment-level view of apps](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#environment-level-view-of-apps)
1. Locate the **Dataverse Accelerator** app listing.
1. If an update is available, click the **Update available** link next to the listing.

> [!TIP]
> Enable auto app updates for the Microsoft - Power CAT publisher to automatically receive updates when available (not necessary for new environments created after October 1st 2023).

### Delete

You can delete the Dataverse Accelerator app from an environment using pac cli.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting the Dataverse Accelerator app will not delete the underlying capibilities presented in the app. The app is just a vessle, presenting platform features in a modern shell.

Using pac cli, [connect to the target environment](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/connection#pac-connection-create) and execute the three [solution delete](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/solution#pac-solution-delete) commands below:

```powershell
pac solution delete --solution-name msdyn_DataverseAcceleratorApp 
pac solution delete --solution-name DataverseAccelerator 
pac solution delete --solution-name DataverseAccelerator_Anchor 
```
