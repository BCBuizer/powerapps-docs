# FAQs about filtering canvas galleries with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQs) describe the AI impact of filtering Power Apps canvas galleries with Copilot. 

##  What is Filter with Copilot? 

**Filter with Copilot** is a feature for users of Power Apps who want to filter their galleries using natural language. It surfaces in galleries of canvas apps that are backed by SharePoint (will expand to other data sources in the future). 

## What are the system’s capabilities? 

It takes the user's input and uses advanced language models to filter, sort, and search the gallery. The user can then add more filters, view and remove current filters, or accept to persist the filtered view. 

## What is the system’s intended use? 

As an AI assistant to users, it filters the gallery based on the user's input. 

## How was Filter with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

We evaluate the feature both qualitatively and quantitatively. To assess the quality of the feature, we're conducting studies with users to gather feedback on their experiences, thoughts about the feature's quality, and suggestions for improvement. We're also monitoring telemetry data to track the number of users who tried the feature, the success rate of the feature, and the ratio of positive feedback to negative feedback.
