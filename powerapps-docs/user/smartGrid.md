# Filter, sort, and search galleries with Copilot (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

You can use Copilot to quickly filter, sort, and search the items in canvas app galleries. Copilot uses a natural language expression to generate a query to the database that scopes the current view of records in a gallery or grid so users can quickly find the records they need.

Copilot allows you to filter, sort, and search galleries using three main types of commands.

- **Filter**: Narrow down the list of records using complex criteria, including _and_ and _or_ statements and relational operators such as _equal_, _greater than_, and _more_.
- **Sort**: Organize the list of records in ascending or descending order.
- **Search**: Find specific records using _starts with_ text.

Copilot doesn't support aggregate queries, such as _top_, _min_, _max_, _sum_, and _average_, as these answers can't be displayed as a list of records.

Filter, sort, and search galleries with Copilot provides five key benefits:

- **Natural Language Commands**: Copilot enables natural language commands. The prompt user interface (UI) helps users formulate sentences by showing different examples of natural language sentences that work.
- **Comprehensive Query Capability**: Users can filter, sort, and search on fields even if the application doesn't provide UI controls for these tasks. For example, you can search for records without a search bar in the application.  
- **Time-Saving for Developers**: Authors save time developing apps since they don't need to develop all the UI controls necessary for the app. Copilot handles this functionality.
-**Query Safety**: Copilot only generates queries that can be run on the server, ensuring that developers don't need to worry about query delegation.
- **Privacy Protection**: Copilot only generates queries that can be executed on the server, ensuring that developers don't need to worry about query delegation.

> - To use this feature, your environment must be in a region with GPU (graphics processing unit) capacity, or your tenant must have the **Move data across regions** checkbox selected. Learn more: [Turn on copilots and generative AI features](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot)
