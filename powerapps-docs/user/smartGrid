# Filter, Sort, and Search galleries with Copilot Smart Grid (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

You can use Copilot to quickly sort, filter, and search the items in canvas app galleries. Using Copilot saves time because you won’t have to worry about scrolling through the gallery to find the items you need.  

When trying to quickly find the gallery items you need, you might worry about spending time scrolling without success. With the assistance of Copilot, you can quickly use natural language to sort, filter, and search the gallery to find the items you need.
