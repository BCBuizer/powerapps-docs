# Use @mention for collaborating with your team using Notes

Collaborate effortlessly by mentioning your coworkers in Notes on the timeline. 

> [!Note]
> The administrator must enable the [**@mention people when in rich text editors to add and notify users** setting](/power-platform/admin/settings-collaboration#end-user-experiences) in Power Platform admin center and [enable in-app notifications](../developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/send-in-app-notifications.md?tabs=clientapi#enable-the-in-app-notification-feature) for the app for this capability to be available.

## @mention a user in Notes
1. Open a row and go to the activity timeline on the page. 
1. Add a note by selecting _Enter a note_. 
1. In the **Description** field, enter **@** and the first few letters of the person’s first name to see a list of options. 
1. Select the name you want. If the user doesn’t already have permission to view the row and you have the Share privilege for the row, you'll be asked to provide basic read permission for the row you are adding a note on.

## Notifications
1. The notification bell icon indicates a new notification when you are @mentioned in a note. 
1. Open the notification center and select the notification to navigate to the record on which you were mentioned.
