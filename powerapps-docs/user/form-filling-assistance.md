# Copilot assistance for form fill in model-driven apps 

With Copilot assistance for filling forms for model-driven apps, users receive suggestions generated by AI for fields in main forms. This feature makes it easier and faster to enter data. These suggestions are based on the user’s usage of the app, what information is already available in the form, and their frequently used data. The suggestions are entirely optional, and don't get saved until the user accepts them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is generally available in Dynamics 365 apps.
>
> This feature is a preview feature in Power Apps.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality.
> - Preview features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

To replace a suggestion with a different value, select the field and start typing to overwrite the suggestion. Or, select the field and press the backspace or delete key and then start typing. 

If you have unsaved suggestions in a form and try to navigate away, you get a prompt asking if you want to discard those suggestions. The suggestions are only saved when you accept them. You can continue navigating away or stay on the form to review your pending suggestions. You can also select **Do not show again** to avoid being prompted in the future.
