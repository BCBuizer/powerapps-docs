# Power Apps coding guidelines

Creating a simple canvas Power App is straightforward, but as the application's complexity grows, maintaining code quality becomes crucial. These guidelines describe standards for naming objects, collections, and variables, and guidelines for developing consistent, performant, and easily maintainable apps. The guidelines provide essential guidance for developers who design, build, test, deploy, and maintain Power Apps apps in various environments, including small businesses, corporations, and government entities.

The guidance in these articles provide an updated version, and expansion of, the [PowerApps canvas app coding standards and guidelines white paper](https://pahandsonlab.blob.core.windows.net/documents/PowerApps%20canvas%20app%20coding%20standards%20and%20guidelines.pdf) from 2018.
