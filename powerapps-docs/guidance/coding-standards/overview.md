# Introduction

Microsoft Power Apps is a low-code, high-productivity application development platform from Microsoft. This platform serves as the foundation for creating applications, including but not limited to those within Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Service, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Marketing, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent. Beyond Microsoft's use, enterprise customers can leverage Power Apps independently to develop their custom line-of-business applications. Furthermore, individual users and teams within an organization can harness the platform's capabilities to build personal or team productivity applications with minimal to no code.

## Purpose of the white paper

[This document, released by Microsoft, provides essential guidance for developers who design, build, test, deploy, and maintain PowerApps apps in various environments, including small businesses, corporations, and government entities](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-canvas-app-coding-standards-and-guidelines/).

Creating a simple canvas Power App is straightforward, but as the application's complexity grows, maintaining code quality becomes crucial. With abundant information available about Power Apps across the web, it can be challenging to discern best practices. [This white paper consolidates insights from expert PowerApps makers worldwide, ensuring that you build your canvas PowerApps correctly](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-canvas-app-coding-standards-and-guidelines/)
