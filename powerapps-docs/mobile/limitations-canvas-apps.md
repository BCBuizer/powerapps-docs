# Mobile offline limitations for canvas apps

## Limitations and known issues

- The offline-first feature **works for standalone canvas apps only**. It doesn't work for [embedded canvas apps](../maker/model-driven-apps/embed-canvas-app-in-form.md) or [custom pages](../maker/model-driven-apps/model-app-page-overview.md).

- The offline-first feature works with Dataverse tables only and doesn't support the following Power Fx functions:
   - **Relate**
   - **Unrelate**
   - **UpdateIf**
   - **RemoveIf**
 
- **Filter on column lookup** only supports one level of lookup when the app is enabled for offline.

- **Many-to-many relationships** aren't supported in offline mode.
 
- **Non-Dataverse connectors** like Sharepoint aren't supported in offline mode.

- **Virtual Tables** aren't not supported in offline mode

- **Calculated and rollup fields** - Calculated and rollup fields that are part of rows synced to the client aren't reevaluated by the client. The reevaluation happens on the server when the updated row is synced.

- **Mapped fields** - When you run an app in offline mode, mapped fields arenâ€™t prepopulated when you create a new record from a table that has fields mapped to another table.

- The **autogenerated offline profile** doesn't handle filters. As a result, for each table used in the app, it downloads *all* rows to which the user has permissions.

- Items in a gallery may appear in a **different order** in an offline-capable app if no [sort order](/power-platform/power-fx/reference/function-sort) is selected. Choose a sort order in the gallery control to make sure the app behaves consistently in mobile apps and web browsers.
